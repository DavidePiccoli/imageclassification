# Image classification personal project
This is a personal project where I made a comparison between deep learning and machine learning on image classification. 

I already expected deep learning to perform better on this kind of dataset, but I also wanted to highlight the architectural differences between deep learning models and machine learning models. Machine learning models are simpler, so they might not be suitable for complex tasks, but still they are very efficient when implemented on smaller, well-structured and preprocessed data. Deep learning models are preferable when dealing with complex tasks sich as image classification, but their large computational costs represent a downside that cannot be ignored. 

The notebook uploaded in this repository contains the code I implemented for this project, as well as my comments and explanations of both inputs and outputs of each cell.
